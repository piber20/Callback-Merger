    <description>This is a technical script for modders. However, subscribing to this as a regular user can be useful, as it can improve compatibility between mods.

This script merges all the callbacks registered by mods into a single one for each callback type and extra variable, possibly improving performance, but more importantly, fixing callbacks that wouldn't let later callbacks work.
It also fixes a few bugs and implements a few QOL changes to the callbacks</description>
