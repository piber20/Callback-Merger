    <description>This is a technical script for modders. However, subscribing to this as a regular user can be useful, as it can improve compatibility between mods which dont have this bundled

NOT NECESSARY IF A MOD AT A HIGH POINT IN THE MOD LIST INCLUDES THIS ALREADY!


Technical info:

This script merges all the callbacks registered by mods into a single one for each callback type. This fixes callbacks that wouldn't let later callbacks work.

It also fixes a few bugs and implements a few QOL changes to the callbacks, including implementing an &quot;early&quot; and &quot;late&quot; callback system

Early and Late callbacks always trigger before or after callbacks added normally respectively.
Late callbacks receive what the last normal callback returned as an argument, allowing detection of stuff like:
   - if another mod prevented damage
   - if another mod prevented an item use
and more! This opens up a lot of possibilities and better intercompatibility between mods that make use of this feature.
Early and late callbacks cannot return any values.
